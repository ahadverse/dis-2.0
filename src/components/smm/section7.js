          Simply having social media accounts for your brand or business is very
          important because it will increase the credibility of your brand or
          business. If your brand or business does not have social media
          accounts, or if the accounts are not regularly updated and optimized,
          then these social media accounts will not be of any use to your
          business. Unoptimized accounts will do nothing to build trust with
          your customers. So today optimizing social media and giving regular
          updates have become very important to stabilize a business.
