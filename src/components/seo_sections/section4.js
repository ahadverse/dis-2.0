          When traffic searches on the search engine, they use a specific
          keyword, and afterward, the search engine shows them related websites
          about their investigation. When any business does SEO in a particular
          niche and keyword, their website drives organic and medium traffic to
          their website, which helps them get ranked quickly in the search
          engines. So, in that case, as much as a visitor you will drive to your
          site, your conversion rate will be higher.
