        <br />
        8.2 We will share statistical and demographic information about our

          14. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS FOR EU USERS ONLY
        </h1>
        14.1 The provisions in this Section only apply if you are a user who is
        located in the European Union (“EU”). These provisions take precedence
        over any inconsistent provisions in the remainder of this Privacy
        Policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.2 Portability You have the right to obtain from us the Personal Data
        that you have previously provided to us, and which we process on the
        basis of your consent in a structured, commonly used and
        machine-readable format and a right to request that we transfer such
        Personal Data to another party. If you wish for us to transfer the
        Personal Data to another party, please ensure you detail that party and
        note that we can only do so where it is technically feasible. We are not
        responsible for the security of the Personal Data or its processing once
        received by the third party. We also may not provide you with certain
        Personal Data if providing it would interfere with another’s rights
        (e.g. where providing the Personal Data we hold about you would reveal
        information about another person).
        <br />
        <br />
        14.3 Erasure You may request that we erase the Personal Data we hold
        about you in the following circumstances:
        <br />
        (a) you believe that it is no longer necessary for us to hold the
        Personal Data we hold about you;
        <br />
        (b) we are processing the Personal Data we hold about you on the basis
        of your consent, and you wish to withdraw your consent and there is no
        other ground under which we can process the Personal Data;
        <br />
        (c) we are processing the Personal Data we hold about you on the basis
        of our legitimate interest and you object to such processing. Please
        provide us with detail as to your reasoning so that we can assess
        whether there is an overriding interest for us to process and retain
        such Personal Data;
        <br />
        (d) you no longer wish us to use the Personal Data we hold about you in
        order to send you promotions, special offers, marketing and lucky draws;
        <br /> or (e) you believe the Personal Data we hold about you is being
        unlawfully processed by us.
        <br />
        <br />
        Please provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the
        request to assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for
        erasure. However, we may retain the Personal Data if there are valid
        grounds under law for us to do so (e.g., for the defence of legal claims
        or freedom of expression) but we will let you know if that is the case.
        Please note that after deleting the Personal Data, we may not be able to
        provide the same level of servicing to you as we will not be aware of
        your preferences.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.4 Retention of Personal Data
        <br />
        We retain your Personal Data as long as needed to provide services or
        products to you, or as required or permitted by applicable laws, such as
        tax and accounting laws. If you make a request for erasure of your
        Personal Data 3 and we determine that there is a valid basis for your
        request, we will endeavour to erase the Personal Data within 30 days of
        your request, or inform you if it will take longer.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.5 Objection against Profiling and Targeted Marketing
        <br />
        At any time you have the right to object to our processing of Personal
        Data about you in order to send you promotions, special offers and
        marketing messages, including where we build profiles for such purposes
        and we will stop processing the Personal Data for that purpose. Please
        provide as much detail as possible on your reasons for the request to
        assist us in determining whether you have a valid basis for objection.
        However, we may retain the Personal Data if there are valid grounds
        under law for us to do so.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.6 Restriction of Processing to Storage Only
        <br />
        You have a right to request that we restrict the processing of the
        Personal Data we hold about you to storage purposes only, where:
        <br />
        <br />
        (a) you believe the Personal Data is not accurate, for the period it
        takes for us to verify whether the Personal Data is accurate;
        <br />
        (b) we wish to erase the Personal Data but you want us to just store it
        instead;
        <br />
        (c) we wish to erase the Personal Data as it is no longer necessary for
        our purposes but you require it to be stored for the establishment,
        exercise or defence of legal claims;
        <br /> or (d) you have objected to us processing Personal Data we hold
        about you on the basis of our legitimate interest and you wish us to
        stop processing the Personal Data whilst we determine whether there is
        an overriding interest in us processing and retaining such Personal
        Data.
        <br />
        14.7 Transfer of Personal Data outside the EU
        <br />
        Your Personal Data may be transferred outside of the EU. We take
        appropriate steps to ensure that recipients of your Personal Data are
        bound to duties of confidentiality and we implement measures such as
        appropriate contractual clauses to ensure that the recipients of such
        transfer protect and treat your Personal Data in accordance with all
        applicable personal data protection laws.
        <br />
        <br />
        14.8 Information on Children
        <br />
        <br />
        The Services are not intended for children under the age of 16 who are
        located in the EU. We do not knowingly collect or maintain any personal
        data or non-personally-identifiable information from anyone under the
        age of 16 who is located in the EU, nor is any part of our Site or other
        Services directed to children under the age of 16 who are located in the
        EU. We will close any accounts used exclusively by such children and
        will remove and/or delete any personal data we believe was submitted by
        any child under the age of 16 who is located in the EU.
